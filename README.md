# Adult-Income-Modelling
EDA and Modelling of the Adult dataset. Project mainly used for Machine Learning and TensorFlow practice. Turned into an examination of the effects of grouping on this dataset after reading a few interesting articles online (credit: https://rpubs.com/juliaHuynh/datapreprocess-assignment3). 

Purpose is now threefold: to build models for identifying income based on
demographic, socioeconomic, and gender-based data, to inspect the impact of recategorization (and normalization to an extent) on model performance, 
and to compare the modelsâ€™ performances against each other when trained under identical conditions.
The dataset I used is the Adult dataset, which is available on the UCI machine learning repository (link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).
I begin by performing an initial exploratory analysis of the dataset. This will help to identify any potential outliers,
missing values, or other anomalies that may need to be addressed in subsequent steps.
The Adult dataset contains a wide range of variables, including both categorical and numerical type data,
such as age, education level, work hours, and marital status.
My research questions primarily focus on the
extent to which these variables are associated with differences in income levels, alongside the effects of my
specific recategorization technique on model performance.

See EDA file for my specific recategorization method.
